        <h2> A family favourite</h2>
        <p> A juicy and flavorful carne asada starts with a delicious carne asada marinade. 
            This recipe begins with a 24-hour marinade to allow the flank steak to soak up all the tasty and fresh flavors before 
            grilling. Whether you serve it as tacos, a salad topping, or simply chow down on the tender, 
            flavor-packed steak by itself, this will be the best carne asada you've ever experienced.</p>

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
            <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>⅓ cup lime juice</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped canned chipotle pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>Flank Steak</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. 
                Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; 
                stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 
                1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap 
                and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>
            <li> Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. 
                Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and 
                marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</li>
        </ol>
